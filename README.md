# This repository includes all the arduino code that were used in conjuction with Hercules-API to create Danix43's software infrastructure
* Only the code in WeatherStation folder works with the API, the rest is not guaranteed or it doesn't work at all

All of this is made and tested when using an ESP8266 and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. Other arduino based devices may not work, but with some tweaks can be ajusted for any IoT machine.
